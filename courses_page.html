            <p>A honeypot is a cybersecurity technique that involves creating a decoy system, network, or application to attract and deceive malicious actors. It is designed to simulate a vulnerable or enticing target that appears attractive to attackers, diverting their attention and gathering information about their tactics, techniques, and motives.</p>

            <p>A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious act in which multiple compromised systems, often forming a botnet, are used to flood a target system, network, or website with an overwhelming amount of traffic or requests. The intention behind a DDoS attack is to exhaust the target's resources, such as bandwidth, processing power, or memory, rendering it inaccessible to legitimate users.</p>
